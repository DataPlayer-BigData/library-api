Type of API
-------------
1) SOAP(Simple Object Access Protocol)
2) REST API

1) SOAP
    - SOAP uses XML
    - SOA(Service oriented architecture) and ESB(Enterprise Service bus) evoloved
    - SOAP Envelope
        -SOAP Header
        - SOAP Body
    - It uses HTTP protocol

    DISADVANTAGE
    --------------
    1) Heavy weight protocol: WS-Addressing, WS-Transactions, WS-Security
    2) XML: Messages are bigger
    3) Complex
    4) Handling needs more computing resources
    5) Simple testing is also not simple


REST Constraints
----------------
1) Client-Server :  Separation of concerns.
2) Stateless : EAch client request is treated independently by the server
3) Cache : Responses are explicitly labelled as cacheable or non-cacheable.
4) Uniform Interface : it should not change depending on business context.
5) Layered System : Solution can comprise of multiple layers.
clients-->Web layer-->API Gateway-->ESB-->Messaging system-->service
6) Code on Demand : Optional constraint. Client can extended the functionality by excuting some code like some script or applets.


Difference between API and services
-----------------------------------
API-Contract
Service - API+implementation


Why API Management?
-----------------------------------
- Security
    - Data protection
    - Threat detection
    - Access Control
    - Identify management

- Analysis
    - Drilling down into API traffic data
    - understand traffic spikes
    - Creating reports to understand the API behaviour
    - API which are in high demand
    - identify under-performing APIs

- Monitoring
    -It helps operation's team increase API availability for application developers, customers, and partners.

- Alerting
    - Set up alerts on your APIs which will enable operatinons to be pro-active.

- Portal
    You would want developers to securely and quickly gain acess.
    https://developer.igirgroup.com/british_airways and resgister

- Documentation
    - you want the consumes/developers (external/internal) to consume those APIs.

REST : Resource
-----------------
- REST talks about resources and URI
- In plain English, Resource =Noun


HTTP for REST
-------------
- REST was proposed by Dr Roy Fielding
- REST is not HTTP
- Data and functionality are considered as resources
    -URI
    -Opertions
    -Standardized Protocol:HTTP

Why HTTP? because HTTP satisfies most of the constraints:
- Client-Server interaction
- HTTP Header(cache-control) used for cache control
- HTTP interactions are Stateless
- HTTP supports Uniform interface constraint because:
    - It is based on URIs
    - It's platform and programming language agnostic.
- HTTP can fulfill Layered-System constraints

RMM(Richardson-maturity-model
------------------------------
-Three factors
    -HTTP
    -URI
    -HATEOAS

-Level 0: All SOAP baesd web-services here
-Level 1: make use of URI. every resource identified by unique URI.
-Level 2: makes use of URIs and HTTP, HTTP methods
-Level 3: use of all 3 factors.


+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Library System
--------------
- Library APIs : Expose REST APIs. Use of JSON as data format
- Database : MySQL as our RDBMS. Handle relationships using JPA
- API Design Documentation: Swagger/Open API 3.0
- API implementation : Java and SpringBoot, SQL as DDL
- API Management: Apigee API Gateway
- API Testing: ?
- API Monitoring: ?
- API Security : ?
- API Deployemnt:?


Step1 : Create database and user
----------------------------------
Create database library_db;
create user 'springuser' identified by 'springuserpassword';
Grant all on library_db.* to  'springuser'@'%';


Step2: Create GitHub Repository
-------------------------------
$ cd /Users/apple/training/webServices/LibraryManagementSystem
$git init
$git remote add origin https://github.com/DataPlayer-BigData/library-api.git
$git pull origin main
$git add -A
$git commit -m "initial commit"
$git push origin master
Username : ACCESS TOKEN
PASSWORD: LEAVE BLANK AND PRESS ENTER

##Create develop branch for developer
$git checkout -b developer
$git push origin developer

##Change default branch
library-api repository-->Settnig-->Branch

##Verify branch. Whether you are working on develop branch or not
$git pull origin developer

##Create new branch for every feature. Hence, create feature/publisher branch.
$git checkout -b feature/publisher-create-api
$git push origin feature/publisher-create-api  #This will push local repository to github remote repository

## Now go to the https://github.com/DataPlayer-BigData/library-api
##Now need to merge feature/publisher-create-api to developer repository. To do this follow below steps:
1) Select feature/publisher-create-api branch
2) Click on Pull Requests -->New pull request-->Create pull request-->Create pull request-->Merge pull request-->confirm merge

##If we want to create new feature then first pull updated codes from developer repository(on github). To do so follow below steps:
$git checkout developer
$git pull origin developer

#Create new branch for publisher get api. First develop new api, then create branch and push
$git checkout -b feature/publisher-get-api
$git status
$git add -A
$git commit -m "Get Publisher API working"
$git push origin feature/publisher-get-api
#After that go to https://github.com/DataPlayer-BigData/library-api
#Then click on Compare & pull request
#Click on  Create Pull request-->Merge Pull request-->Confirm Merge
